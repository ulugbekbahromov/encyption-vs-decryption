### Project - Encryption VS Decryption

### About
Privacy is an important matter is the realm of the Internet. When sending a message, you want to be sure that no-one but the addressee with the key can read it. The entirety of the modern Web is encrypted - take https for example! Don’t stay behind: hop on the encryption/decryption train and learn the essential basics while implementing this simple project.
### Learning outcomes
Gradually get familiar with Java, paying special attention to working with files and the command line.

### What you’ll do and what you’ll learn
- [x] __Stage 1/6:__ Encrypted!
  - Learn to input the data and encrypt it, replacing the letters.
- [x] __Stage 2/6:__ Knowledge is key
  - Learn to encrypt messages with a numeric key, using the Caesar cypher.
- [x] __Stage 3/6:__ Decrypted!
  - Encrypting a message is only half of the deal: now learn to decrypt it as well, using a standard Unicode table.
- [x] __Stage 4/6:__ I command you
  - Practice working with the command line, using it for passing the mode, the key and the string.
- [x] __Stage 5/6:__ X-Files
  - Work with files: learn to store your data in a file.
- [x] __Stage 6/6:__ Choices, choices
  - Add the possibility to choose a specific encryption algorithm: Ceasar or Unicode.
